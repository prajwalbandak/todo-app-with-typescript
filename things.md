The e.preventDefault() function is used in JavaScript and many JavaScript frameworks, including React, to prevent the default behavior of an event.

When an event occurs, such as submitting a form or clicking on a link, the browser typically performs a default action associated with that event. For example, clicking on a link would navigate to the URL specified in the href attribute, or submitting a form would refresh the page.

By calling e.preventDefault() within an event handler, you can prevent the browser from executing its default behavior for that event. This allows you to override the default behavior and perform custom actions instead.

Here are a few common use cases for e.preventDefault():
Here are a few common use cases for e.preventDefault():

Form submissions: In many cases, you might want to handle form submissions using JavaScript instead of allowing the browser to perform the default form submission action. By calling e.preventDefault() within the form submit event handler, you can prevent the form from being submitted and handle the data using JavaScript, such as making an AJAX request or performing client-side validation.

Anchor links: When handling clicks on anchor links (<a> tags), you might want to prevent the browser from navigating to the linked URL immediately. Instead, you can use e.preventDefault() to intercept the click event and perform custom actions, such as smooth scrolling within the page or loading content dynamically without a full page refresh.

Keyboard events: Keyboard events like pressing the Enter key inside an input field might trigger form submission by default. To prevent this behavior and perform custom actions, you can call e.preventDefault() within the keypress event handler.

By using e.preventDefault(), you have more control over event handling and can implement custom behaviors based on your application's requirements.
